4. Troubleshooting & FAQ
Issue
Solution
App won't start
Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable.
UI freezes during loading
The app uses background threading; wait a few seconds for the AI to finish generating questions.
"Game Over" appears immediately
This occurs if you select the wrong answer or the timer hits zero.
Questions seem repetitive
The app pulls from current OU Daily articles. Try again later when new news is published.

OU Trivia App: Technical Developer Documentation
This section provides a technical deep dive into the core modules of the OU Trivia App. It is intended for developers looking to understand the automated pipeline that scrapes current news and converts it into AI-generated trivia.
1. Data Collection: parseOUDaily.py
The ArticleScraper class handles the extraction of raw news from the OU Daily website.
•
Technology: Uses requests for fetching HTML and BeautifulSoup4 for parsing.
•
Cleaning Pipeline:
o
Newsletter Stripping: Automatically removes common email subscription prompts (e.g., "FREE SIGN UP") from the article body.
o
Footer Cleaning: Truncates editorial footnotes and commenting policies.
o
Regex Formatting: Collapses multiple blank lines to maintain clean text for the AI prompt.
•
Output: Returns a tuple consisting of the title_text and content_text.
2. The Logic Engine: generate_trivia.py
This module acts as the orchestrator, connecting the scraped news to the OpenAI API.
•
AI Integration: Utilizes the gpt-4.1-mini model to transform current news into multiple-choice questions.
•
Context Window Management: To avoid token overflow, the content text is limited to the first 6,000 characters before being sent to the AI.
•
Difficulty Scaling: The script explicitly prompts the AI to adjust question complexity:
o
Easy: Straightforward facts obvious to most students.
o
Medium: Requires attention to specific article details.
o
Hard: Targets tricky or very specific information within the source text.
•
Prompt Engineering: The prompt forces a strict 4-line output format to ensure compatibility with the JSON parser.

The JSONBuilder class is responsible for structured data storage and parsing raw AI text.
•
Strict Parsing: The parse_openai_output method validates that the AI responded in exactly 4 lines, ensuring the "Answers" line is a valid Python list.
•
Index Validation: Confirms the correct_index (0–3) accurately reflects an item within the provided answer list.
•
Persistence: The save_all method bundles the questions into a dictionary and writes them to trivia_questions.json.
o
Note: This file is overwritten every time a new game is generated to ensure fresh content.
